# Simple ask & response with OpenAI, Vue, FormKit & Tailwind

### A small application that allows users to select an AI engine and ask any question. User is then returned the prompt entered & response sent back. They can then delete all or individual responses. Based off of Shopify's Frontend Challenge https://github.com/criscunas/FunWithGPT-3. Very minimal styling. Rebuilt to mainly get familiar with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS.

1. git clone this repo
2. npm install 
3. create a env file and provide your OpenAI key under VUE_APP_api_key = "your_key_here"
4. npm run serve
